            The domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris)[4] is
            a domesticated descendant of the wolf. The dog derived from an
            ancient, extinct wolf,[5][6] and the modern grey wolf is the dog's
            nearest living relative.[7] The dog was the first species to be
            domesticated,[8][7] by hunter–gatherers over 15,000 years ago,[6]
            before the development of agriculture.[1] Their long association
            with humans has led dogs to be uniquely adapted to human
            behavior,[9] leading to a large number of domestic individuals[10]
            and the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be
            inadequate for other canids.[11] The dog has been selectively bred
            over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and
            physical attributes.[12] Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and
            color. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding,
            pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military,
            companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. This influence
            on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best
            friend."
